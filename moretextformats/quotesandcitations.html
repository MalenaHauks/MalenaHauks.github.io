        <p>There's much written on www about history of the Internet.For example, about the first 
            graphical Internet browser on the web - Mosaic.</p> 
        <p><blockquote>Mosaic is the first widely-used graphical World Wide Web browser, released on April 22, 
            1993 by the NCSA with the help of Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina. A big competitor 
            to Mosaic was Netscape, which was released a year later.</blockquote></p> 
        <p>Today's Internet browsers we use today (e.g., Internet Explorer, Chrome, 
            Firefox, etc.), got their inspiration from the Mosaic browser. This and much more 
            can be found at</p>
