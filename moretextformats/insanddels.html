        <p>by Netscape, <del>and is supported by Netscape 2.0 and </p>
        <p>higher, and Explorer 4.0 and higher.</del> It is primarily used to </p>
        <p>add interactivity and multimedia to web pages. <ins>Beside the </p>
        <p>name, <mark>JavaScript has nothing to do with Java </p>
        <p>programming language</mark>. The fact that the names are similar 
        <p>to each other has led to some confusion.</ins></p>
