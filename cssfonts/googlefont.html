            <b>Pixelify Sans</b><br>
            Pixelify Sans fonts are a unique style of typography 
            that originated in the 1980s with the rise of computer graphics 
            and video games. Pixel fonts are characterized by their blocky, 
            pixelated appearance, which is achieved by using a grid of 
            small, square pixels to create each letterform.

            <b>Space Grotesk</b><br>
            Space Grotesk is a proportional sans-serif typeface variant 
            based on Colophon Foundry's fixed-width Space Mono family (2016). 
            Originally designed by Florian Karsten in 2018, Space Grotesk 
            retains the monospace's idiosyncratic details while 
            optimizing for improved readability at non-display sizes.

            <b>Croissant One</b><br>
            Croissant is a typeface inspired by the Parisian spirit, 
            in the people and the landscapes there. The lowercase 
            letters have smooth round shapes, and a nice long out-stroke 
            to connect nearly every glyph, reminding the reader of elegant 
            French handwriting. The uppercases have a classical structure 
            and soft terminals that embody the spirit of this 
            multi-purpose typeface.
